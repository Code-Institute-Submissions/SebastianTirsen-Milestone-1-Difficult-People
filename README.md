<u>Design</u>

*Colour Scheme*

The first of the three main colors used is called "Space Cadet" and is used for the background to the navigation links, the hero image and the footer. The second color is called ""Floral white" and is used for the main part of the body. The third color is called "Dark orange" and is used for the buttons.

*Typography*

The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being loaded into the site correctly. Montserrat is both attractive and appropriate. I makes for a modern appearance.

*Imagery*

The large, background hero image is constructed of three individual pictures that is chosen to catch the visitors attention and incite feelings of recognition with the people in the pictures. The texts that overlay the pictures are written to ask the visitor important questions and call them to action and make them sign up to services.

<u>Wireframes</u>

One initial wireframe was done in Adobe XD. After that no further work with the Wireframe was done. For that reason the finished site looks a bit different than the first and only Wireframe mockup of the site.

**Known Bugs**

On some mobile devices the first heading on top oft the filtered hero Image is not quite in the center of the page.

The menu stopped working in mobile view. This was due to the fact that the script links where in the wrong order and the Bootstrap links/scripts where loaded in the wrong order. After chatting with Tutor support i rearranged the script tags in the following order:

﻿1: jQuery  
﻿2: popper  
﻿3: bootstrap

That solved the issue.
