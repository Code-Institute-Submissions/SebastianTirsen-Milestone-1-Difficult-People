This is the website for the swedish company "Difficult People". The site was ordered by the founder of the company Tobias Höckert to be used to draw the attention of potential clients. It is designed to be easy to use with only four pages and responsive to tablet size and mobile screens.

<u>Design</u>

*Colour Scheme*

The first of the three main colours used is called "Space Cadet" and is used for the background to the navigation links, the heroimage and the footer. The second colour is called ""Floral white" and is used for the main part of the body. The third colour is called "Dark orange" and is used for the buttons.

*Typography*

The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being loaded into the site correctly. Montserrat is both attractive and appropriate. I makes for a modern appearance.

*Imagery*

The large, background hero image is constructed of three individual pictures that is chosen to catch the visitors attention and incite feelings of recognition with the people in the pictures. The texts that overlay the pictures are written to ask the visitor important questions and call them to action and make them sign up to services.

<u>Wireframes</u>

One initial wireframe was done in Adobe XD. After that no further work with the Wireframe was done. For that reason the finished site looks quite a bit different than the first and only Wireframe mockup of the site.

First Time Visitor Goals~~

*Home page*

As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the kinds of services the company provide.

When the users enters the site, the first thing they see on the top of the page is the company logo to the left and an easy to read navigation bar in contrasting colour on the right. The navigation makes it possible for the user to go to the About-, Tools- and Contact-page directly by clicking on their respective links. The navigation also lets the users return to the Home-page by clicking on the Home-link. The Users can also return to the Home-page by clicking the company logo on the top left hand side of every page. This layout  at the top of the page is present on all the pages.

Beneath the navigation there is a hero image that consists of three images with two questions and one statement that calls the users to action and the purpose is to make them want to learn to handle difficult people.  Underneath the hero Image is a button for the users to press if they want to contact the company. The user can choose to click the button or scroll further down the page. When the users presses the button they are redirected to the contact-page to fill in their contact-information and send them to the company for further contact.

After the button there are two texts called "Underlying factors" and "Important tools" to familiarize the users with the subject.

When the users scrolls further the next content is a presentation of the companys services in the form of four fields of text with the headlines "Breakfast lectures", "Workshops", "Unstoppable! - Full-day training" and "One-to-one. The users can read about the services and then decide to scroll back to the contact-button and press it, or scroll further down the page to get more content.

The next piece of information further down the page is testimonials from people that has used the companys services and have given some kind of statement about how they feel about the services. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for these testimonials to understand what the users think of the services and the company and see if they are to be trusted. 

At the bottom of every page there is a section with a short desription of the company purpose, clickable icons representing the links to three social media platforms and lastly the companys physical address in Sweden. 

About page

Tools page

Contact page

The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.

At the bottom of the first 3 pages there is a redirection call to action to ensure the user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.

On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.

I also want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

  

Once the new visitor has read the About Us and What We Do text, they will notice the Why We are Loved So Much section.

The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.

At the bottom of the Contact Us page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the organisation on social media which highlights the links to them.

Returning Visitor Goals

As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the new programming challenges or hackathons.

  

These are clearly shown in the banner message.

They will be directed to a page with another hero image and call to action.

As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.

  

The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact Us" Page.

Here they can fill out the form on the page or are told that alternatively they can message the organisation on social media.

The footer contains links to the organisations Facebook, Twitter and Instagram page as well as the organization's email.

Whichever link they click, it will be open up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.

The email button is set up to automatically open up your email app and autofill there email address in the "To" section.

As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the Facebook Group link so that I can join and interact with others in the community.

  

The Facebook Page can be found at the footer of every page and will open a new tab for the user and more information can be found on the Facebook page.

Alternatively, the user can scroll to the bottom of the Home page to find the Facebook Group redirect card and can easily join by clicking the "Join Now!" button which like any external link, will open in a new tab to ensure they can get back to the website easily.

If the user is on the "Our Favourites" page they will also be greeted with a call to action button to invite the user to the Facebook group. The user is incentivized as they are told there is a weekly favourite product posted in the group.

Further Testing

The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.

The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.

A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.

Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

On some mobile devices the Hero Image pushes the size of screen out more than any of the other content on the page.
