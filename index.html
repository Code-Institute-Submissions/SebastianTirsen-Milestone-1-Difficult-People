                <h3>Underlying factors</h3>
                <p><strong>What is it that really causes communication between people to fail and what effects does it have?</strong>
                Ambiguity, loss of prestige or a perceived lack of respect are common factors that can contribute to conflicts between people.
                Stress, peer pressure, balance of power, drugs and mental illness are some of the underlying reasons why people sometimes do not behave as we expected.
                Worry about being exposed to threats and violence contributes to stress and poorer job satisfaction. What consequences could an unexpected incident with a troublesome person have for your staff, and in the long run for the brand?

                <h3>Important tools</h3>
                <p><strong>How well prepared are your staff to deal with upset, affected or aggressive people in their daily activities?</strong>
                In all professions where there is one or more interfaces with customers, clients or guests, it is crucial to have solid knowledge of interpersonal interaction and tools for conflict management.
                Learning to prevent and manage conflict-filled situations is also an important part of every workplace's systematic work environment and safety work.
                Learn the techniques to deal effectively with people who do not behave as we expected, e.g. upset customers, threatening clients or self-absorbed visitors.
                Having tools and knowledge reduces the risk of ill health, sick leave and staff turnover.</p>
