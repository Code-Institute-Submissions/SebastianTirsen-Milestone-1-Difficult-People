                        <p>Since 2016, I have helped clients who have been affected in various ways by difficult people to build a stronger, braver and freer life - simply a life on their terms.
                        My professional background is a behavioral scientist and life coach, but I also have a past as both a doorman and treatment assistant.
                        Over the years, I have worked to rehabilitate the mentally ill, addicts and criminals, which has given me deep knowledge of the extremes of human behavior.</p>

                        <h4>Threats and violence at work have more than doubled</h4>
                        <p>Since the 1980s, the proportion of gainfully employed who have been exposed to threats or violence at work has increased from 2 to 5 percent. Threats and violence at work affect women to a greater extent than men.
                        Results from the Surveys of Living Conditions (ULF / SILC) 2016–17 show that 5 per cent of gainfully employed people aged 16–64 have been exposed to threats or violence at work at some point during the past 12 months.
                        This corresponds to approximately 220,000 people. The increase has been greater among women than men. (Source: Statistics Sweden 2018)</p>

                        <h4>Pathological narcissist or self-absorbed asshole?</h4>
                        <p>In the general debate, "psychopath" and "narcissist" are used as insults, instead of saying e.g. "He's so self-absorbed, what an idiot!" The risk is that if we use diagnoses as abusive words, the meaning begins to slip.
                        In the end, in the worst case, EVERYONE who has ever been rude, unfaithful or dishonest is sorted into the same union as severely personality-disordered people, which dilutes the concept and risks making it more difficult to distinguish the people who
                        in the clinical sense actually has a personality disorder! Simply put, all narcissists are self-absorbed, but not all self-absorbed individuals are narcissists.</p>
                        <p>Self-centered people can show genuine remorse and empathy if, for example, someone points out that their behavior is selfish. Therefore, they can also change their habits and behavior.
                        Admittedly, a person with narcissistic personality disorder can fake something similar to humility or remorse (if it benefits him). Beneath the surface, however, the narcissist will never see the environment as anything other than puppets playing their part.
                        The most likely reaction if someone points out the narcissist's inappropriate behavior is to explode, or mock and diminish the person who exposed them.</p>
                        <p>Self-absorbed people thrive when they receive positive attention and therefore want to be in focus. A person with narcissistic personality disorder usually presents a picture of themselves as infallible and paints what they have achieved as extraordinary.
                        They become impatient and quickly lose interest if the discussion is about someone other than themselves. Where the self-absorbed says: "See me!", The narcissist exclaims rather "See how wonderful and special I am - unlike YOU!”</p>

                        <h4>Is your colleague a psychopath?</h4>
                        <p>Three behaviors to watch out for:</p>
                        <p>1. Seduce</p>
                        <p>The psychopath is at first overwhelmingly charming and makes you feel selected and special. But after a period of courtship, he downplays his appreciation and instead begins to criticize your efforts and undermine you.
                        The psychopath's goal is for you to go on eggshells and constantly want to be okay. Although they are usually extremely charming, they completely ignore how the surroundings feel.</p>
                        <p>2. Lying</p>
                        <p>With the help of his social agility and unwavering self-confidence, the psychopath manipulates his surroundings. The part of the brain that regulates emotions is rejected, which means that the psychopath does not experience remorse, fear or shame.
                        Be on your guard and trust your gut feeling! If you receive repeated proof that your colleague does not stick to the truth, communicate as much as possible via email, to have written proof of what has been said.</p>
                        <p>3. Control </p>
                        <p>Does the colleague, or the boss, sometimes behave excessively in control? A psychopath does not tolerate being challenged, or that someone else is in the spotlight. If you get positive attention, you can therefore
                         expect to have a really dangerous enemy in the workplace.</p>
